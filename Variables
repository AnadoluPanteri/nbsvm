args
  Interpreted as a quoted array of arguments to append to the kvm command line.
  Only useful in /etc/nbsvm/* -- command line arguments are automatically
  included in the kvm invocation.
  Default: none

bridge
  The network bridge to add the default network tap device (tap-$vm or
  tap-$class-$vm) to.
  Ignored if unset.
  Default: none

bs
  A value to be used in place of the default 1MB bs option to dd, used by the
  clone command.
  Default: $BLOCKSIZE or 1048576 (1MB)

class
  A global variable which determines what default device names to use, which
  files in /etc/nbsvm to use, etc.
  Default:
    none unless the command called is not nbsvm, in which case it is that
    command with the 'vm' suffix (which is not necessary) stripped.

cmd
  Internal variable used to keep track of which command is being run.

count
  Internal variable which I ought to rename.

ddopt
  Extra options included verbatim in the dd command (without quoting).
  Default: none

debug
  Flag to print debugging output (essntially the -x flag).
  Default: none

dev
  Internal variable naming the VM's hard drives.

display
  Options controlling how to run the display.
  Default: -display vnc=unix:$drawer/vnc.sock

drawer
  Where kvm keeps its socks.
  Default: /var/lib/nbsvm/$vm or /var/lib/nbsvm-class/$vm

drive_devs
  Internal variable listing all of the VM's hard drives.

drive_if
  The interface type to use to connect the default drives.
  Default: virtio

drives
  If set, overrides any attempt by lvm to calculate drives and drive options.
  Default: none

drive_size
  Size (passed to lvcreate -L) of new drives.
  Default: 10G

gold
  Used in the filename template of the device to clone or snapshot. See source
  for a full description of snapshot_lv, source and gold.
  Default: gold

mem
  Amount of RAM to start the VM with.
  Default: 512M

net_if
  The network device type to emulate. See network for a fuller description.
  Default: virtio-net-pci

network
  Override the network device options.
  
  The default network configuration is to have one network device (named net)
  of type $netif. If the mac variable is set it specifies the emulated device's
  mac address. The device is paired on the host with a tap device named
  tap-$vm or tap-$class-$vm.

  The exact configuration used is:
          -device ${net_if:-virtio-net-pci},netdev=net${mac:+,mac=$mac}
          -netdev tap,id=net,ifname=tap-${class:+$class-}$vm,script=no,downscript=no
  
  If the network variable is not set, then nbsvm is using its default network
  configuration and the tap device is brought up:
          ifconfig tap-${class:+$class-}$vm up
  
  If the network variable is not set _AND_ the bridge variable _IS_ set, then
  the newly-brought up tap device is added to that bridge:
          brctl addif $bridge tap-${class:+$class-}$vm

next
  Internal variable used to calculate the next drive id to create.

size
  Internal variable used in calculating the size of the device to clone.

snapshot_lv
  The full LV name to clone or snapshot. See source for a full description of
  snapshot_lv, source and gold.
  Default: nbsvm-$gold or nbsvm-$class-$gold

snapshot_size
  The amount of space given to an LVM snapshot.

source
  The path to the source device to clone or snapshot. The path can be the full
  path to the device or just the volume group and logical volume ($vg/$lv).
  Only LVM devices are supported (no cloning from a file yet).

  The default is calculated using $vg and $snapshot_lv, or $vg, $class and
  $gold (default: "gold") if $snapshot_lv isn't set:
	  $vg/$snapshot_lv
	    or
	  $vg/nbsvm-$gold or $vg/nbsvm-$class-$gold
  
stop
  Internal variable used to work out what to do.

usb
  Full override of USB settings. By default there are USB devices so in order
  to start a VM without USB this needs to be set to whitespace. The null string
  is regrettably insufficient to disable USB entirely.
  Default: -usb -usbdevice tablet

vg
  Where to create and look for VM drives.
  Default: vg0

vm
  Internal variable used to track which VM to deal with. Set from the first
  argument to nbsvm.

vnc_port
  The method used to connect a VNC client to KVM is a pretty bad jury rig using
  socat to forward the unix socket listened to by kvm to a localhost TCP socket
  which vncviewer (whatever that points to) connects to. This means that
  everything tries to listen to (which eventually fails) and connect to (which
  doesn't) port 5900. Override the port with this.
  Default: 5900
